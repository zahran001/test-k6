# Running a k6 Test

## Prerequisites
- Install [k6](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) on your system.

## How to Run a Test
1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run the following command, replacing `test3-portfolio.js` with your test file name if needed:

```powershell
k6 run test3-portfolio.js
```

You can also run other test files (e.g., `test1.js`, `test2.js`) the same way:

```powershell
k6 run test1.js
k6 run test2.js
```
